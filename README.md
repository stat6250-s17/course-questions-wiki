[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 1]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the right way to concatenate two datasets in a new one?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* By using the following syntax: 
```SAS
DATA SAS-data-set;
       SET SAS-data-set1 SAS-data-set2 ...;
RUN;
```
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Is the order of the smallest dataset significance in one-to-one merge SET data statement? 
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why there is no end-of-file condition when you use direct access?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When would you use this one-to-one merging?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): When the observations in both datasets are in the same order and the columns are different.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): What decide the number of observations?
- Answer (yren10-stat6250): The observation in new dataset is the number if observations in the smallest original data set.


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 2]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the main difference between using SET and Merge statements in DATA step?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How to append two dataset, when common variable has different type of data?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  If the type of a variable in the DATA= data set is different than in the BASE= data set, SAS replaces all values for the variable in the DATA= data set with missing values and keeps the variable type of the variable specified in the BASE= data set
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What steps you must take to prevent continuous looping while using direct access to read data?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You either add a STOP statement to the DATA step, or use programming logic that checks for an invalid value of the POINT= variable.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): What is the benefit of using interleaving?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): The output dataset is sorted by the BY variable.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Will the Set statement combine table together by some sequence?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): Yes, pick the same element in first variable together and so on by sequence of the first table.


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 3]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the default oreder of the output obsevations when SET statement is used to combine two datasets?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What happen when if the type of common variable differ in the datasets to be concatenated?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  SAS will stops process the DATA step and issues an error message stating that the variables are incompatible.
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How do we determine when the last observation in an input data set has been read?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We use the END= option in the SET statement.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): With concatenate, what happens when rows have the same values for a particular variable (e.g. ID)?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): Nothing, both rows are in the output.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Does how many different variablesin two data set will brings the same amount of observations by using one set in set statment?
- Answer (yren10-stat6250): No, its all depends, it does different when its weather numric or categorial. Does different when it has different variables. Concatenating appends the observations from one data set to another data set. The
new data set contains the total number of records from all input data sets.


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 4]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Before concatenate datasets, what should we pay attention to?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):*  It is important to know the structure and contents of the input datasets by checking the describtive part and the data as well.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Can we concatenate more than two data set in SAS using single SAS concatenate procedure?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How do you select the variables that you want to drop or keep?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can use the DROP= and KEEP= data set options in parentheses after a SAS data set name.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When should you use concatenate?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): When both datasets essentially have the same columns and the missing columns are non-essential.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Why its missing the observation 2, not putiing all observation together by order?


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 5]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the best way to combine multiple datasets which have a primar-key variable?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can we merge the two datasets with multiple common variables in single SAS Procedure by specifying multiple variable names in BY statement?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): When we read a single data set, which command do we use to specify the data set to be read?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We use SET statement.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When two datasets have the same variable, how is the length of the variable determined?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): The length is determined by the first dataset.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Does it matter if we put 2nd first and 1st in second after the set statment, will this move change the combined data?


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 7]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* In MERGE statement, what the possible values for IN option? and how it can be utilized?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):*  The IN= variables have two possible values: 0 and 1 which indicates whether a data set contributed information to the observation: MERGE SAS-data-set1 <(IN=variable)>...
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How do you prevent the values of the common variable Blue from being overwritten when you merge the two data sets?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  Using RENAME procedure, we can change the name of common variables to sustain its original value from both dataset and prevent overwriting,
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What's the other programming features for manipulation data sets that the DATA step can provide?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We can use IF-THEN/ELSE logic with DO groups and DO loops to control processing that is based on one or more conditions, specify additional data set options, process variables in arrays and use SAS functions.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When two datasets have the same variable, how do you keep just the values from the first dataset?
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Is there another way to prebent the overwritten other than rename the variable?


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 9]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What will happen if two datasets were combined with the same variable name but with different type?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can I get the result of one-to-one merge using PROC SQL command?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What's the BY statement in SAS for?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): In a match-merge, how do you exclude records with missing values?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): use the IN= data set option and an IF statement.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Does the merage statement will keep all the different observations and variables from both table?


[basic_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally (from Week 6 Overview)]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Using Program Data Vector (PDV) has many advantages, but what are its disadvantages?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Does rename option in merge statement modify the name of actual dataset or only valid for merge statement?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): For example, if we have a data set containing missing variables, how does the SAS combine the data sets horizontally and correctly, which means that the corresponding variables are sorted  and then combined horizontally?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): Why does the column name not also change when we use rename? Why does renaming the column name to a space result in the desired column name?
- Question (yren10-stat6250): If two datasets having different observation which means not all in common, will SAS show all observations and use dot presents missing values after combined?


[optional: adv_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally (from Week 6 Overview)]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Wwhich statement will have faster performance combine four dataset, using merge statement or proc sql statement?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What kind of error will occur if the order of these AS statements are converted improperly?
