* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):*  Formats can be assigned temporarily in PROC steps and permanently in DATA steps.
- Question (kveng−stat6250): What is COMMA10 format?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Can we take the label and format statement in the data step away as they will be overwritten by "proc print" anyway ?
- Question (lzhao4-stat6250): Can temporary labels which assigned in a PROC step override the permanent labels which assigned in a Data step?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is the difference between COMMA6 and COMMA10?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): Do temporary labels and formats override permanent labels and formats?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): Yes, they do.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What is the operation priority of the operators?
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): Is the formatting in an input statement in a DATA step overridden by a format statement in the DATA step?
- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): Yes, a Format statement in a DATA step is a permanent formatting assignment.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): What to use for formatiing the variable, how it formatted in the PROC PRINT output?

[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 6]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How many different ways are there of writing an IF-THEN statement in SAS?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What is the order of execution in case of multiple IF-THEN statement?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  Each IF statement is evaluated in order it define, even if the first condition is true. 
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* When we use IF-THEN statement, how to differenciate between variable type?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): How does Count+1 work?
- Answer (kveng−stat6250): The count+1 statement creates the variable count and adds one to each oservation as SAS processes the data step.

- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): The effect is the same in terms of the results, but the processing is different. In a series of if statements, every if statement is evaluated by the compiler. In an if-else construction, once there is a condition satisfied as true, the rest of the conditional statements are not evaluated.

- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What happen if LENGTH statement appears after any other reference to the variable in the DATA step?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  If the variable has been created by another statement, then a later use of the LENGTH statement will not change its length.
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Why we might want to specify a length for a character variable, rather than let the first assigned value determine the length?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): What is LENGTH statement?
- Answer (kveng−stat6250): You can use a LENGTH statement to specify a length (the number of bytes) for a variable before the first value is referenced elsewhere in the DATA step. For example: LENGTH Type $ 8;
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What is the consequence of the subsequent observations having longer values than the first observation without the length of the variable being specified in the statement ?

[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 8]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the benefit of using ELSE in an IF-THEN statement?

- *Answer* (lwang30-stat6250) : When the dataset is large, IF-THEN/ELSE statement can process much faster than multiple IF-THEN statement in which all the observations are evaluated one by one.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How to use ELSE statements with the IF-THEN statement?
- Answer (lzhao4-stat6250): You should write ELSE statement immediately follow the IF-THEN statement. Additionally, you can use multiple ELSE statements when needed.

- Question (yren10-stat6250): How many  ELSE statements we can write in one statement(IF-THEN)?
- Question (nly13-stat6250): What is the benefit of using ELSE in IF-THEN statement?
- Answer (nly13-stat6250): Using IF-THEN statements without the ELSE statement causes SAS to evaluate all IF-THEN statements. Using IF-THEN statements with the ELSE statement causes SAS to execute IF-THEN statements until it encounters the first true statement. 
- Question (hhu9-sta6250):Why in SAS, we should type first "else" parallel with "if" in first column?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250):  How can you assign an initial value to a variable whose value is assigned by a sum statement?

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* In case of using LENGTH statement to assign a length to a character variable, where it supposed to be located?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* It must be the first reference to the character variables in the DATA step. Therefore, the best position in the DATA step for a LENGTH statement is immediately after the DATA statement.
- Question (kveng-stat6250): In which order should the LENGTH statement appears in the DATA step?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Where should we place the LENGTH statement in order to let variable "Type" have a length of 10 ?

[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 8]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How would continous looping happen when submitting a program?

[basic_recipe_for_combining_data_vertically (from Week 7 Overview)]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why would a length statement need to appear when creating wider character variable?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): If there are two data set having same data structure but variable names and position are different? Can we combine this dataset vertically by using additional keep and retain statement?
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the main advantage of using "IN=" Statement?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): When combining the data vertically, can we sort and combine the data at the same time?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What is an example of the expansion of the dataset by applying both two indicator variables that has been defined in the "set" statement ?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): From the recipe we know that IN= dataset option can be used in conjunction with if or else conditioning. Beside this, what else we can do with IN= dataset option?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is the function of the SAS statement DO?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): How does the IN= data set option work?

- Question (rluo-stat6250): How many indicator variables should be created when combining the data sets?
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): How can one create useful data structures to evaluate business logic in combining data files vertically?
- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): An "in" (for "in-file") variable is created along with a datasource variable that holds a reference to the file. The in-variable then gets assigned a value of 1 if the data comes from the indicated file and 0 if not, which can further be used in a business analysis scheme regarding the file through the use of the datasource variable assignment.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): If we are combining data vertically or horizontally, what does missing observations or variables will show in result or output when combining them?

- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What would be the best option to combine datasets in SAS?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How to rewrite concat statement using pro sql?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  The two data sets can be combined vertically, or concatenated, in a DATA step by naming them both in a single SET statement. Here is the example where two dataset 'one' and 'two' are being concatenated:
```SAS
DATA concat; 
SET one two; 
RUN;
*The equivalent SQL statement of concatenated is;
CREATE TABLE concat AS
SELECT *
