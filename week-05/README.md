- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the benefit to having a fileref?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Filerefs temporarily point to a storage location for data and they reference external files.  It is a good function to have if you need to find a specific dataset that has been saved.
-	Question (lzhao4−stat6250):  Do Filerefs perform the same function as librefs?
-	Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): Both LIBNAME and FILENAME statements are global.  Librefs and filerefs remain in effect until you change them, cancel them, or end your SAS session.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): can we change filerefs during using it? why?
- Answer (hhu9−stat6250): No, we can not change or cancel files during using it.

- Question (rluo-stat6250): What is the function of the PUT Statement?
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): Are values of the variables set to missing as part of the initial execution step of a DATA step, or does that happen at the beginning of the compilation phase?
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Why are ERROR and the program data vector reset to zero at the end of the data step?

- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can we create new dataset from existing multiple dataset in SAS data step? (without using proc sql)
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the difference between "Retain" and "Keep" in DATA statement?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): Is there a limit number of specific rows or columns data that will be the subset of an SAS data set?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): What does the SET statement in the DATA step do?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): It tells SAS to read an observation from one or more SAS data sets. If more than one data set name appears in the SET statement, the resulting output data set is a concatenation of all the data sets that are listed. 
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): Even though it looks redundant to have the same variables in both the RETAIN and KEEP statements, why is this necessary?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): Is there any statement that would incorporate both RETAIN and KEEP into a single process?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): Except the data step, is there any other statement where the program data vector (PDV) will be used in SAS ?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can we tell an error that is from execute phrase or compile phrase?
- Question (nly13-stat6250): If retain and keep have to be the same, why isn’t there a single statement that is simplified to do both? 
- Answer (nly13-stat6250): The simplified version would be proc sql, uses less code for same result, however it is limited by memory.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): How can we actually use program data vector function?
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): Can a retain statement be sufficient in itself, given that it specifies the order of the existing variables?
- Answer (aoneill2−stat6250): No, a retain statement must always be accompanied by either a "keep" or "drop" statement. The retain statement only specifies order, wherease the "keep' or "drop" statement determines the existence of the variables in the program.
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Can we create a single SAS data set from mulitple external raw data sets?
- Question (yren10−stat6250): How we ise "Retain" exactly, and what it does in DATA statement?
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How much practice would it typically take for one to fully understand the programming data vector in SAS?
-	Question (lzhao4-stat6250): What different aspects do retain and keep modify with?
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): How important is the data itself? can we get the result that what we want by using specific method?

- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  can we create new variable using proc sql statement in SAS?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  Yes, using LABEL = option we can create new variable using SAS proc sql statement.
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* In SQL inquery, what is the substitue of proc means and proc freq?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): Does using PROC SQL create a different data structure than using the DATA statement? If I want to sort data using PROC SQL, does the data need to be read into a TABLE?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): Even though PROC SQL requires less code (since it uses the select clause to combine the functions of the RETAIN and KEEP statements), when are the times when you want to use PROC SQL and when are the times you would want to use the regular DATA step?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): What happens if we don't sepecify the program to quit at the end?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): If *prog glm* is an interactive proc, why can we still run other statement without enclosing *proc glm* by a "quit" ? 
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How does SAS run sql and what’s the difference of the coding language between sql and SAS?
- Question (nly13-stat6250): What is the memory limit to proc sql?
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): What statement can be left out of the recipe without affecting its output?
- Answer (aoneill2−stat6250): The WHERE statement can be omitted.
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): What is the PROC step used in the advanced recipe for creating analytic datasets?
- Answer (aoneill2−stat6250): The PROC SQL step is used.
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): What is one advantage of a PROC SQL step?
- Answer (aoneill2−stat6250): The PROC SQL statement uses les code that a DATA step.
- Question (aoneill2−stat6250): How do you end a PROC SQL step?
- Answer (aoneill2−stat6250): A PROC SQL step must end with a QUIT statement.
- Question (yren10−stat6250): How to use PROC SQL to do the subset and make concatenate datasets?
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How important is PROC SQL command in comparison to the other SAS commands?
-	Question (lzhao4-stat6250): Can select statement be used to drop a column in PROC SQL?
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): Why we can not use "where" and "group by" together???
