- Question (yyan11−stat6250):What is the value of the automatic variable _ERROR_ when the observation that contains any error?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): _ERROR_ signals the occurrence of an error that is caused by the data during execution. The default value is 0, which means there is no error. When one or more errors occur, the value is set to 1.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When there is an error, does the DATA step stop executing?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): No, the value where the error occured will be missing and the program continues to read data.
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): Why does the value of the automatic variable _ERROR_ only go from 0 to 1?

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the difference between "Retain" and "Keep" in DATA statement?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): Is there a limit number of specific rows or columns data that will be the subset of an SAS data set?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): What does the SET statement in the DATA step do?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): It tells SAS to read an observation from one or more SAS data sets. If more than one data set name appears in the SET statement, the resulting output data set is a concatenation of all the data sets that are listed. 
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): Even though it looks redundant to have the same variables in both the RETAIN and KEEP statements, why is this necessary?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): Is there any statement that would incorporate both RETAIN and KEEP into a single process?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): Except the data step, is there any other statement where the program data vector (PDV) will be used in SAS ?



[optional: adv_recipe_for_creating_analytic_datasets (from Week 5 Overview)]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* In SQL inquery, what is the substitue of proc means and proc freq?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): Does using PROC SQL create a different data structure than using the DATA statement? If I want to sort data using PROC SQL, does the data need to be read into a TABLE?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): Even though PROC SQL requires less code (since it uses the select clause to combine the functions of the RETAIN and KEEP statements), when are the times when you want to use PROC SQL and when are the times you would want to use the regular DATA step?
- Question (kveng−stat6250): What happens if we don't sepecify the program to quit at the end?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): If *prog glm* is an interactive proc, why can we still run other statement without enclosing *proc glm* by a "quit" ?
