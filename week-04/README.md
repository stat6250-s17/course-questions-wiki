## Week 4 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 4 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-4" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 4 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-4 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can you use a mix of values that includes both character values as well as numeric values?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): There are particular keywords you can use together with numeric values such as "LOW" and "OTHER" but cannot be a combination of character and numeric values.


[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 4]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can we reformat "text" or character values with numeric values instead? How would we approach this?


[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 5]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What is the largest numeric value we can use? What about character values - does it go beyond Z such as restarting with AA?


[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 6]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Why is the characters used in the label limited to 256? 


[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 7]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Are there other keywords available, what are they and does this mean we cannot use these key words as a value?


[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 8]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What is the advantages or reason why one would use PROC FORMAT vs. DATA FORMAT?


[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 1]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): 


[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 2]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): If we use a combination of var and by, can we produce a cross tabulation of MEANS statistics by selected variables?


[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 4]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What happens if the BY variables are not indexed or sorted? Would we get an error?


[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 7]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): How should we handle numeric variable in PROC FREQ? 
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): We can re-format the numeric variables and create a shorter list of ranges.


[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 8]
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What other outputs would be useful to understand FREQ data?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): It would be nice if a histogram plot or box-whisker plot is given.

[recipe_for_summarizing_qualitative_values (from Week 4 Overview)]
