[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 1]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What will happen if the SUBSTR function is on the left side of an assignment? How about on the right side of an assignment?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): When the SUBSTR function is on the left side of an assignment statement, it replaces variable values. When SUBSTR is on the right side of an assignment statement, it extracts variable values.

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How SAS will deal with variable values in arithmetic operation?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* SAS automatically converts the variable values to numeric by creating a temporary numeric value for each 
character value which will be used in the calculation. Besides, SAS issues a message in the log showing that the conversion has been occurred.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): In which situation would the automatic conversion occur?

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What happens if skip the INPUT function or the PUT function when converting data?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): SAS will detect the mismatched variables and will try an automatic character-to-numeric or numeric-to-character conversion. However, this process doesn't always work. Therefore, it is always best to include INPUT and PUT functions in your programs to avoid data type mismatches and circumvent automatic conversion.
- Question (kveng−stat6250): What is the different between comma6 and comma7 here?
- Answer (kveng−stat6250): The numeric informat "comma6." tells SAS that you want to read in a number that contains a comma and takes up to 6 spaces (including the comma)
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): How many values must be accommodated in a format for a numeric value - do characters like commas and decimals count?
- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): Yes, in a format statement such as comma7. the comma counts as one of the 7 "digits" even though the comma itself is not really a numerical value itself.
