[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 1]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the right way to concatenate two datasets in a new one?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* By using the following syntax: 
```SAS
DATA SAS-data-set;
       SET SAS-data-set1 SAS-data-set2 ...;
RUN;
```
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Is the order of the smallest dataset significance in one-to-one merge SET data statement? 
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why there is no end-of-file condition when you use direct access?
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): When would you use this one-to-one merging?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): When the observations in both datasets are in the same order and the columns are different.
- Question (lzhao4-stat6250): How does SAS reading values when same named variables occur?
- Question (kveng-stat6250): What are the methods of combining data set?
- Answer (kveng-stat6250): There are one-to-one reading (statement: SET), concatenating (statement: SET), interleaving (statement: SET, BY), and match-merging (statement: MERGE, BY)
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): What would the new dataset be if the variable "VarZ" in the second dataset changes to "VarY" ?
- *Answer* (lwang30-stat6250): SAS would recognize a common variable "VarY" between two datasets and overwrites the observation from the first dataset by the values from the second dataset, so only two columns would be present in the new dataset. 
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How often is match-merging used in SAS?
* Question (aalamri−stat6250): Which statement can help us combine two or more datasets into one dataset?
* Answer(aalamri−stat6250):  We can do that by using the “SET” statement and follow it with each dataset.
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What are the five methods of combining observations from two or more data sets into a new data set?
- Answer (dlee117-stat6250): They are one-to-one reading, concatenating, appending, interleaving, and match-merging.
- Question (nly13-stat6250): If the 2 data sets have unequal number of rows, what will happen during the merge?
- Answer (nly13-stat6250): In the last row of observations, the SET statement will read in the observation in the first set, but will stop when there is nothing to read in from the second set. This observation will not be in the output.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): Is there any requirements for the datasets to perform One-to-One merging?
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): For a one-to-one match, how many set statements are needed?

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How One-to-One Merging Selects Data?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): When you perform one-to-one merging, the new data set contains all the variables from all the input data sets. If the data sets contain variables that have the same names, the values that are read from the last data set overwrite the values that were read from earlier data sets.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can you merge together two table sets with different number of records? 
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): Yes, in one-to-one merging for example will simply take the first observation from one table and merge with the first observation from the second table and so on - they do not have to be of equal number of observations.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): What decide the number of observations?
- Answer (yren10-stat6250): The observation in new dataset is the number if observations in the smallest original data set.

[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 2]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the main difference between using SET and Merge statements in DATA step?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How to append two dataset, when common variable has different type of data?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  If the type of a variable in the DATA= data set is different than in the BASE= data set, SAS replaces all values for the variable in the DATA= data set with missing values and keeps the variable type of the variable specified in the BASE= data set
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What steps you must take to prevent continuous looping while using direct access to read data?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You either add a STOP statement to the DATA step, or use programming logic that checks for an invalid value of the POINT= variable.

- Question (rluo-stat6250): What data will be selected when performing concatenating?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): All of the observations from the first data and all of the observations from the second data will be selected.
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): How many set statements are used to append one file with another?
- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): Only one set statement is required, followed by the two file names.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How Interleaving Selects Data?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): When SAS interleaves data sets, observations in each BY group in each data set in the SET statement are read sequentially, in the order in which the data sets and BY variables are listed, until all observations have been processed. The new data set includes all the variables from all the input data sets, and it contains the total number of observations from all input data sets.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can you move two tables based on an unique identifier vs. based on order of observation?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): Yes, you can still do this with one-to-one merging. You can sort both variables based on the single unique identifier and then merge the two.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Will the Set statement combine table together by some sequence?

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How do we determine when the last observation in an input data set has been read?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We use the END= option in the SET statement.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): With concatenate, what happens when rows have the same values for a particular variable (e.g. ID)?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): Nothing, both rows are in the output.

- Question (kveng-stat6250): Which method does this problem invoke?
- Answer (kveng-stat6250): This problem invokes the concatenating method.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): Can we use a "merge" statement for these two datasets directly ?
- *Answer* (lwang30-stat6250): No, we can't, as the "merge" statement requires the two datasets to have at least one common variable. Rename of one of the variables should be done prior to using the "merge" statement for these two datasets.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What happens if the two data sets being merged don't have any columns in common?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  The datasets would be merged with any unspecified values marked as missing.  Though the values aren't necessarily merged together, there will be one merged dataset.
* Question (aalamri−stat6250): What is the “END” option use for?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is the difference in the coding between one-to-one matching and concatenating?
- Answer (dlee117-stat6250): With one-to-one matching, you use individual SET statements per data set while with concatenating, you have multiple data sets in one SET statement separated by commas.
- Question (nly13-stat6250): During concatenate, what will happen if the variable names are not the same?
- Answer (nly13-stat6250): If the variable names are not the same, it will generate a new column for each dataset.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What is the difference between appending and the concatenating?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): Concatenating will create a completely new dataset while appending just simply add one to another.
- Question (aoneill2-stat6250): If two files each have different variables, can they be appended?
- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): Yes. The resulting output file will contain columns that reflect the variables in both input files.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How Concatenating Selects Data?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): When a program concatenates data sets, all of the observations are read from the first data set listed in the SET statement. Then all of the observations are read from the second data set listed, and so on, until all of the listed data sets have been read. The new data set contains all of the variables and observations from all of the input data sets.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What does concatenate do and how is it different from one-to-one merging?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): Concatenate is another way of merging data tables. However, records of the 2nd table is appended or added on to the first table. So if you have 6 records in the 1st and 6 in the 2nd, you will end up with 12 total records in the concatenate table.
- Question (yren10-stat6250): Does how many different variablesin two data set will brings the same amount of observations by using one set in set statment?
- Answer (yren10-stat6250): No, its all depends, it does different when its weather numric or categorial. Does different when it has different variables. Concatenating appends the observations from one data set to another data set. The new data set contains the total number of records from all input data sets.
- Question (hhu9-stat6250): What will happen if the first table have a long list of observations? we will not see the observations of second table in new table, so why dont the new table pull all observations of second table to parallel with the observations of first table.

- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the difference between concatenating, appending, and interleaving?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Concatenating appends the observations from one data set to another, while appending adds the observations in thesecond data set, and interleaving intersperses observations from two or more data sets.
* Question (aalamri−stat6250):  When inputting datasets in SAS, how important is the order of these datasets when combining them?
* Answer (aalamri−stat6250):   very important because SAS reads datasets based on the closest ones to the “SET” statement so it may affect the outcome.

- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): The length is determined by the first dataset.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How will the output data set display when couple variables with the same name are in more than one input data set?
- Answer (lzhao4-stat6250): Values of the same-named variable in the first data set in which it appears are overwritten by values of the same-named variable in subsequent data sets.
- Question (kveng-stat6250): When merging two tables with the same column label, can we specify which table to overwrite?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250): In a "merge" statement, what is the effect on the output dataset if the same-named variable from two datasets have different types ?
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why must the overlapping variable values be set to missing when they are merged?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  If the values in the same column variable over two data sets are different, there is no way in telling which the proper values are.  Therefore, the values are set to missing.
