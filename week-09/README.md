## Week 9 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 9 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-9" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 9 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-9 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 1]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): If you do not specify a BY clause, what is the increment value for DO loops?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): The increment value for DO loops is 1.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 2]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why the index variables can be dropped from the data set?

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 3]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you make it easier to manage nested DO loops?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can indent the statements in each loop.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 4]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Under what situations that we use DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements can be used within iterative DO loops to combine conditional and unconditional execution. 

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 5]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What's the difference between DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): The DO UNTIL statement executes a DO loop until a condition becomes true while the DO WHILE statement is used to execute a DO loop while a condition is true.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 6]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you run DO loops within DO loops?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250):  You assign a unique index variable to each loop and terminate each DO loop with its own END statement. 

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 7]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250):  Once the loop's index value exceeds the stop value, the DO loop stops, and processing continues with the following DATA step statement. So how can we re-open the previous Do loop if necessary?

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 8]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why the start value must be greater than the stop value when you decrement a DO loop by specifying a negative value for the BY clause? What kind of error will occur if the request is not fulfilled?

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 9]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you specify that how many times that a DO loop executs?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can specify how many times a DO loop executes by listing items in a series.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 10]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How to construct an iterative DO loop?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): By specifying an index variable and the conditions that will execute the loop.
