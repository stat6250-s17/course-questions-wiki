[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 1]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): If you do not specify a BY clause, what is the increment value for DO loops?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): The increment value for DO loops is 1.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Are there any statements that can be used to combine the functions of data step and proc step ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250): Yes, a SAS program can consist of any combination of DATA and PROC steps, so you can combine them in a statement.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What is the benefits of the DO loops statement?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): It can greatly reduce the number of statements required for a repetitive calculation.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What is a DO loop?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): You can execute SAS statements repeatedly by placing them in a DO loop. DO loops can execute any number of times in a single iteration of the DATA step. Using DO loops lets you write concise DATA steps that are easier to change and debug.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the benefit of having a DO statement as opposed to a normal SAS command?

- Answer (lzhao4-stat6250): DO loops process a group of statements repeatedly rather than once. 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Are there any example of statement that can be used to combine DATA and PROC steps?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Can start value will be larger than stop value in do statement?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  Yes, when you use a negative BY clause value, the start value must always be greater than the stop value in order to decrease the index variable during each iteration.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): Can DO loops be used to combine DATA and PROC steps?
- Answer (hhu9−stat6250):no, it can not be used to combine DATA and PROC steps.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 2]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why the index variables can be dropped from the data set?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  It is useful to create an index variable to count and store the number of iterations in the DO loop, but it isn't something you need to keep once iterations have been stored.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What’s the value of the index “month” in the last iteration of the loop ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  The last iteration of the loop has the value 12 for the index month since it is the last month in a year.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What increment values can be applied in the DO loops statement?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): Numbers, variables, or SAS expressions.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How to construct DO loops?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): To construct a DO loop, you use the DO and END statements along with other SAS statements. The value of the index variable can be changed within the loop. When creating a DO loop with the iterative DO statement, you must specify an index variable. The index variable stores the value of the current iteration of the DO loop. You may use any valid SAS name.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How many DO loop statements can be used in one DATA step?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): What decides the number of iterations in DO statement? 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): If the BY statement is not included in the Do loop, what happens?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): Then it will default to 1 unit increments.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Can we use character values as series of items for do loop execution?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): Yes, all character values, with each value enclosed in quotation marks can be used to execute do loop for executes once for each item in the series.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): what will happen if there is no break step in DO loops?


[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 3]

- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What new variables are generated in this do loop ?
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What does the index variable do in the DO loop statement?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): The index variable stores the value of the current iteration of the DO loop.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): Can I dropp the index variable from the data set?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): In most cases, the index variable is needed only for processing the DO loop and can be dropped from the data set.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Does the "do count" statement cover both numerical and categorical variables?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How the DO loop perform repetitive calculations?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  When you submit a DATA step, it compiles and then executes once to generate data.  Then, the program data vector is created and variables are assigned.  Then, the DO loop executes and the values of the variables are accumulated and incremented until the end of the DATA step is reached.  The iterative DO statement determines how many repetitions are calculated.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can the BY statement be anything other than numeric? Does it have it be integers?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  The BY statement specifies an increment value for the index variable, so it does need to be numeric.  There is no requirement for how much you want to increment by, but it is typically best if you increment by one for each iteration, so using integers for BY is best.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can we exit do loop before reaching its stop value mentioned in do loop statement?
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): How to write do count if the rate is compound interest?


[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 4]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Under what situations that we use DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements can be used within iterative DO loops to combine conditional and unconditional execution. 
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What would be the stored value for Year if an “until” statement is used ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Under the DO UNTIL statement, the variable Year is incremented by one, so the value would be Year + 1.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What specific steps must be achieved in order to correctly nest DO loops?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  In order to nest DO loops correctly, you must assign a unique index-variable name in each iterative DO statement and each DO loop with an END statement.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How to count iterations of DO loops?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): In some cases, it is useful to create an index variable to count and store the number of iterations in the DO loop. Then you can drop the index variable from the data set. The sum statement Year+1 accumulates the number of iterations of the DO loop and stores the total in the new variable Year. The final value of Year is then stored in the data set, whereas the index variable counter is dropped. The data set has one observation.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What other variables can be used in a DO loop statement aside from Year?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How the DO loop executes in the DATA step? 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What if we used DO UNTIL instead? Would the stored YEAR be different? 
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Can we use do statement to create primary key in dataset?
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): Why stored value is great than the stop value?


[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 5]

- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why does the number of iterations include the year after the last one noted in the DO loop statement?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): What happens when placing an explicit OUTPUT statement in a DATA step?
- Answer (lzhao4-stat6250): The OUTPUT statement overrides automatic output.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What happens when you include the OUTPUT statement?

- Answer (hhu9−stat6250): the last value is is on the last iteration of the DO step. It is 2004.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 6]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you run DO loops within DO loops?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250):  You assign a unique index variable to each loop and terminate each DO loop with its own END statement. 
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Does the number of new observation generated by do loop equal the number of iteration ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  No, you can create multiple observations in one iteration of the DATA step.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): Can conditional and unconditional execution of DO loops be achieved?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What happen when I place an explicit OUTPUT statement in a DATA step?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): By default, every DATA step contains an implicit OUTPUT statement at the end of the step. But placing an explicit OUTPUT statement in a DATA step overrides automatic output, causing SAS to add an observation to the data set only when the explicit OUTPUT statement is executed.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the limit to the number of observations that can be in a DO LOOP statemet?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How to count and store the number of iterations in the DO loop? 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Are increments always necessary and what if you want to do a loop where the iteration is not based on a numeric variable?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Yes, increments are one of the simple specifications to include in a DO loop statment, so it is very important that they are represented.  The purpose of the iteration is to give you a value, so having it be numeric is essential.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What are the differences between Do-Until and Do-While?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): Do Until is executed at least once, but DO while is executed only if the condition is true.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): How to count the number of observations? 
- Answer (hhu9−stat6250): It is the same as iterations.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 7]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250):  Once the loop's index value exceeds the stop value, the DO loop stops, and processing continues with the following DATA step statement. So how can we re-open the previous Do loop if necessary?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  After the DATA steps ends, you can still go back to the previous DO loop if there is more than one observation.  If all observations are executed in the DO loop step, the DATA step ends.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : In what situations should we use DO While or Do Until statements ?

- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How to correctly execute nested DO loops? 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): How does SAS know where in the code is part of the Do loop and should be executed as such?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): The “Do” statement will start the loop and “End;” will stop the loop. Anything within the these two statements are part of the loop
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Which performs faster between Do-Until and Do-While statement?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  It depends on whether expression if true or not.  If the expression is true right away, DO UNTIL executes fairly quickly.  The DO WHILE executes statements conditionally, but not if the expression is false the first time it is evaluated.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): What is the diference between DO WHILE and WHILE loops?


[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 8]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why the start value must be greater than the stop value when you decrement a DO loop by specifying a negative value for the BY clause? What kind of error will occur if the request is not fulfilled?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  This is done in order to decrease the index variable during each iteration.  Failing to do so would result into a data error.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : When is the condition evaluated respectively in other DO loop statements ?
- Question (rluo-stat6250): How to draw sample obervations from a data set by using DO loop?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How to use the DO UNTIL Statement?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): The DO UNTIL statement executes a DO loop until the expression becomes true. The expression is not evaluated until the bottom of the loop, so a DO UNTIL loop always executes at least once. When the expression is evaluated as true, the DO loop stops.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why can't a DO UNTIL statement be evaluated at the top?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Does DO UNTIL statement allow you to execute DO loops when the condition is false? 
- Answer (lzhao4-stat6250):  DO UNTIL statements enable you to execute DO loops based on whether a condition is true or false.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What is the difference between DO WHILE and DO UNTIL?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): can we use both DO while and Do until in same do statement?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  You can use both DO statements in the same statement, but it will only execute the DO statement that occurs first in the DATA step.
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): When does DO while statement and DO UNTIL run?
- Answer (hhu9−stat6250): check before executing and check after executing.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 9]

- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can specify how many times a DO loop executes by listing items in a series.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Are DO While and DO Until statements complementary to each other ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Both statements have similiarities and differences, but they aren't complementary to each other because they are not complete opposites.
- Question (rluo-stat6250): Can Do loop be used in the proc statement?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Since the DO loop executes exclusively in DATA steps, it isn't used the PROC statement.
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How to use the DO WHILE Statement?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): Like the DO UNTIL statement, the DO WHILE statement executes DO loops conditionally. You can use the DO WHILE statement to execute a DO loop while the expression is true.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How are DO UNTIL and DO WHILE statements similar?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  The biggest similarity between both DO statements is that they execute DO loops conditionally.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): What is the difference between DO UNTIL statement and DO WHILE statement? 
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What happens when you accidentally excuse an infinite Do loop?

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 10]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How to construct an iterative DO loop?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): By specifying an index variable and the conditions that will execute the loop. 
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What would the statement be if DO Until is used in this case ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  For problem 10, the code would be as follows:
data work.go250;
set perm.cars;
	do until (Distance=250);
		do until (gallons=10);
			Distance=gallons*mpg;
			output;
			output;
		end;
		end;
run;
- Question (rluo-stat6250): Is there any disadvantages of using DO loops statement?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What different between the DO UNTIL and DO WHILE statements?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): An important difference between the DO UNTIL and DO WHILE statements is that the DO WHILE expression is evaluated at the top of the DO loop. If the expression is false the first time it is evaluated, the DO loop never executes. For example, in the following program, because the value of Capital is initially zero, which is less than 50,000, the DO loop does not execute.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What do the "when" and "over" statements indicate and can they be a DO LOOP statement as well?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): The WHILE expression is evaluated before or after the execution of the DO loop?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  DO WHILE is evaluated before the execution of the DO loop because the DO LOOP doesn't execute if the DO WHILE expression is false, so WHILE must come first.
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Can you have multiple nested DO UNTIL and DO WHILE loops?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can we break outside of do loop before completion of all do steps?
- Question (hhu9−stat6250): Why there are 3 "." after "1 to 10"?
