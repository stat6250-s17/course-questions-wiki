## Week 2 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 2 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-2" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 2 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-2 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 1]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Wht is themaximum number of observations per dataset? What about variables/columns?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Do missing values affect the structure of the data set?
Question (nly13-stat6250): Is it possible to set the name as an ID?

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 2]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Why should we use “run;” steatment many times within SAS program instead of one time at the end?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* The "run;" statement is often not strictly required, as SAS will assume you want to start a new step when it sees data or proc. However your code will be clearer and easier to understand if you make the end of each step explicit.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Add run statement after each program step is an essential?character variable is valid when contains letters and underscores.

Question (nly13-stat6250): What’s the difference between  infile and set?
Answer (nly13-stat6250): From what I’ve researched, infile allows you to pull data records from external files.

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 3]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How many type of variables does SAS support?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Can numeric variable contains letter and underscore?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): A numeric variable can only contain numeric values. A 
Question (nly13-stat6250):How are some of the values read as character under AcctNum if there are numbers?
Answer (nly13-stat6250): By adding a $ at the end of AcctNum, it makes all of its values a character.

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 4]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How to represent missing data in SAS dataset?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Can missing value indicates a different type of variable?
Question (nly13-stat6250): Can SAS read determine value types automatically when reading in a mixed data set?

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 5]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Can a character variable begins with a number?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): What is the basic rule to set a valid variable name in SAS?
Question (nly13-stat6250): In the text it says a variable can only begin with a letter or an underscore, but if does converting it to a character with $ make a difference?

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 8]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Considering all numeric variables have a default length of 8 bytes, what is the maximum value that can SAS accept for a numeric variable?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* 
![8 byte](https://github.com/aalshehry-stat6250/course-questions-wiki/blob/Week-2/week-02/8byte.JPG?raw=true)
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): No matter a numeric variable contains how many digits it has a default length of 8?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): Numeric variable balance always has a default length of 8 unless you set a specific length.
Question (nly13-stat6250): Is there a maximum length for character variables?
Answer (nly13-stat6250): character variables can be 1-32 characters long.

[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 3]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Where and how to use YEARCUTOFF option?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250):  YEARCUTOFF= option has no effect in some cases?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): The YEARCUTOFF= option has no effect when processing dates with four-digits years, processing dates already stored as SAS date values, and displaying dates with SAS date formats.
Question (nly13-stat6250): In the text it says yearcutoff option really only applies for 2-digit years due to the fact that the century leading two digits may be ambigious. So how would it distinguish between 05 (1905) and 05 (2005)?

[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 7]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How to save your dataset in the permanent library?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How to correctly assign a SAS libref?
Question (nly13-stat6250): How do you remove permanently saved data in SAS?

[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 8]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Without using the YEARCUTOFF= option, how would SAS interpret 11/11/20? Is it 1920 or 2020?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* The default value of YEARCUTOFF= is 1920.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How does YEARCUTOFF= option work on the interpretation of two-digits years?
Question (nly13-stat6250): Can YEARCUTOFF be used for a millennium or is there a different code for that? 

[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 9]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* If a SAS session is ended or a libref is deleted, does the library still exist?
* **Answer (aalshehry−stat6250): In these cases, SAS no longer has access to the files in the library.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Libref exists only during the session in which it is created?
Question (nly13-stat6250): How do you manually clear libref while still in a SAS session?

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Is it mandatory to use “filename tempfile clear;” step? Why?
- Question (lzhao−stat6250): Do we possible to transfer data from SAS dataset to an excel file? How? 
Question (nly13-stat6250): Is formatting ever an issue when getting data from a URL to Excel to SAS?
