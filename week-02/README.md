[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 2]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why does each SAS line end with a semicolon?
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Why should we use “run;” steatment many times within SAS program instead of one time at the end?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* The "run;" statement is often not strictly required, as SAS will assume you want to start a new step when it sees data or proc. However your code will be clearer and easier to understand if you make the end of each step explicit.

- Answer (yren10−stat6250): No, name can't decide the type.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): If a character variable contains only numeric data, can we changed the variable type in SAS from character to numeric?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): A variable can be defined as only one type, so you cannot use the same variable name to convert the values. You create a new variable with the values converted using input function.



[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 4]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why are there some missing values in certain datasets?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Some datasets are more difficult to collect the entire data for than others, which is reasonable considering error is a part of statistics.  Therefore, there will sometimes be an occasional missing value when the data is collected.
