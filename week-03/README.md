[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 1]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why must each SAS statement begin with a DATA or PROC?
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Why code formatting is important?

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): It's a good idea to begin DATA steps, proc steps, and RUN statements on which side to indent statements within a step?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): On the left side.
- Question (kveng−stat6250): Does the code still work without indenting the statements within step?
- Answer (kveng−stat6250): I tested it. The code still work but it's a good idea indeed to indent the statements for better reading.

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How to write SAS statements?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): Although you can write SAS statements in almost any format, a consistent layout enhances readability and helps you understand the program’s purpose. It's a good idea to begin DATA and PROC steps in column one, indent statements within a step, begin RUN statements in column one, include a RUN statement after every DATA step or PROC step.

- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): A "missing RUN statement" error is generated in the log window.
- Question (yren10-stat6250) : Is that important to follow a standard formating or steps when doing SAS coding?
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): What purpose does indenting within a step do? Is it more stylistic or functional?

- Answer (aoneill2-stat6250): A specific error message is generated in the log window that refers to the particular syntax error made. If a semicolon is omitted, the error message reads, "missing semicolon;" if the syntax error is a missing quotation mark, the error message is "unbalanced quotation marks;" and for another common syntax error of chossing an option that doesn't exist, the error message reads, "invalid option," all of which are self-explanatory. 
- Question (yren10-stat6250) : If i have a error, Will the log message indicates my error comes out all the time, or its depends on what error I had?
- Question (cyuan10-stat6250): Do spelling errors really matter beyond standard commands and does the program highlight spelling error?
- Answer (cyuan10-stat6250): No, but it is important you are referring to the correct spelling or variables or command. Also, other readers of your code should be able to understand your coding so correct naming is important.
- Question (lzhao−stat6250): After correcting the errors do we have to clear the log window?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250):  Clear the messages from the Log window can avoid confusing between old error messages and the new messages.
